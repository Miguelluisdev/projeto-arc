  **Arcane Project: Justification, Objective and Planning**

The Arcane Project appears as a final challenge, aiming to consolidate and apply all the skills already acquired, as well as serving as a solid portfolio for future job opportunities, especially before embarking on the journey of learning React and TypeScript.

**Goal:**
The main purpose of this project is to train and improve skills in HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and relevant libraries. Furthermore, it will be an opportunity to create a robust portfolio, highlighting the ability to develop a complete website, from design to functionality implementation.

**Planning:**
By the end of November, the aim is to implement all identified features, create an attractive layout using the canvas and incorporate images and other essential elements. The goal is to establish a solid foundation for the project before focusing efforts on learning React and TypeScript.

**Execution:**
During the execution phase, relevant content about the Arcane series will be added, covering information about seasons, regions, characters, history, duels, transition between Piltover and Zaun, among other details. The progressive development of the site will be documented, incorporating features as they are implemented.

**Functionalities:**
- Informative content about the series, including details about seasons, regions, characters, history, duels, changes between Piltover and Zaun, history of the dolls, among others.
- Theme plugin for visual customization.
- Jinx game as an interactive feature.
- Note: The home and media section are missing since the decision was made to move to React and TypeScript.

**Closing:**
Upon completion of development, the project will be hosted on GitHub, serving as a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating the skills acquired during this stage of learning. It is worth mentioning that the "troca-de-tema.js" file needs a review, as its code is poorly organized.

This project represents not only a milestone in technical skills, but also a strategic step towards modern and more advanced technologies, such as React and TypeScript.
